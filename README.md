# dice-game
A simple dice game (pig game) created by me. 
The game has 2 players in it. The players will have to roll the dice. Each dice rolls will be converted into their score and the score will get accumulated. If the player rolls a number 1, then the score of the player will be saved and the player will switch. The players need to get a score of 100 points in order to win the game. 

Note: You will have to simply extract the folder as it is for the game to work
